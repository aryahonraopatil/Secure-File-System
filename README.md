# A Robust Secure P2P File-Sharing System

A comprehensive overview of the secure peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing system.

## Core Features:

- **P2P Architecture**: 
  - The system fundamentally operates on a Peer-to-Peer architecture, ensuring decentralized data transfer and storage.

- **File Operations**: 
  - Users have the ability to:
    * Create files
    * Delete files
    * Read files
    * Write to files
    * Restore files

- **Version Control**: 
  - Clients are always presented with the latest version of a file. They should never see an older version once they've accessed a newer one.

- **User Permissions and Naming**: 
  - Users can set specific permissions on files and directories.
  - For effective permissions, the system is capable of uniquely naming users.

- **Concurrency**: 
  - The system effectively handles concurrent read and write operations.

- **Data Confidentiality and Encryption**: 
  - File and directory names are treated with confidentiality.
  - Data stored on each peer node is encrypted.
  - Peer-to-Peer communications are encrypted for additional security.

- **Integrity and Authorization**: 
  - Unauthorized file or directory modifications are detected.
  - Only authorized users can make modifications.

- **Malicious Activity Prevention**: 
  - Malicious servers are prevented from creating or deleting files/directories without detection.

- **Logging**: 
  - The system incorporates logs to track each operation.
  - Attack detection features are built based on these logs. 
  - Logs differentiate between unauthorized and authorized access or modifications.

## Security and Detection:

- **Attack Detection**: 
  - Features are in place to detect potential attacks on the system.
  - Unauthorized access or modifications are logged and detected.

- **Vulnerability Assessment**: 
  - Regular assessments are conducted to define and understand potential vulnerabilities in the attack detection system.
