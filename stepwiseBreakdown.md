# P2P Secure File Sharing System with Flask

## 1. Setup:
   - Import necessary libraries (Flask, Flask-Login, Cryptography, etc.)
   - Initialize Flask app
   - Set up database (SQLite for simplicity)

## 2. Define User Model:
   - Fields: username, hashed_password, public_key, private_key, shared_secret, files_owned, etc.

## 3. User Registration Endpoint:
   - Receive username and password
   - Hash password and store in database
   - Generate a Diffie-Hellman key pair (public_key, private_key) for the user
   - Store public_key in database (private_key remains secret on the user's end)
   - Return success or error message

## 4. User Login Endpoint:
   - Receive username and password
   - Validate against stored hashed password
   - If valid, create a session for the user
   - Return success or error message

## 5. Initiate Key Exchange Endpoint:
   - Check user authentication
   - Specify target peer
   - Send own public_key to target peer

## 6. Receive Key Exchange Endpoint:
   - Check user authentication
   - Receive public_key from requesting peer
   - Use own private_key and received public_key to compute shared_secret
   - Store shared_secret for encrypted communication with the specific peer
   - Return own public_key to requesting peer

## 7. File Upload Endpoint:
   - Check user authentication
   - Receive file and filename
   - Use shared_secret to encrypt file using a symmetric algorithm
   - Store encrypted file and update database with file metadata
   - Return success or error message

## 8. File Download Endpoint:
   - Check user authentication and file ownership/permission
   - Use shared_secret to decrypt file for the requesting user
   - Send decrypted file
   - Return success or error message

## 9. File Update Endpoint:
   - Check user authentication and file ownership/permission
   - Receive new file data
   - Use shared_secret to encrypt and store updated file
   - Update file version or metadata in database
   - Return success or error message

## 10. File Delete Endpoint:
   - Check user authentication and file ownership/permission
   - Delete file from storage and remove metadata from database
   - Return success or error message

## 11. Malicious Activity Detector (Middleware):
   - Monitor all incoming requests
   - Check for irregular patterns (e.g., too many requests in a short time)
   - Flag or block suspected malicious activity
   - Log details of the event

## 12. Start Flask App:
   - Set up routes and link to endpoints
   - Start Flask server
